"""07 — Pre-publication gate.

Scans for anything that must not reach a permanent public record. Two severities,
because they are genuinely different things:

  BLOCKING  A draft stamp or unfilled placeholder in a document a reader will see,
            or a credential anywhere at all. These make publication wrong.

  ADVISORY  A [VERIFY] annotation in source code. That is a legitimate engineering
            note, not a defect — but the author should have consciously resolved
            each one, so they are listed rather than ignored.

The mechanical half of the gate. The human half — the author having actually
reproduced and spot-checked the pipeline — cannot be scripted, which is why
docs/VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md ends in a signature line.
